1. Rich becoming Richer, Poor becoming Poorer. 
2. Earth is full of Plastic & Unhealthy.

Brief Solution for Problem 1. On one side tea franchises are growing rapidly and on the other side small tea shops/stalls losing customers. Instead of providing franchise ownership to people who have money. Let’s give an Opportunity to small tea stall businesses to increase their business by standardising their business with branding, attractive outlet design, proper equipment, hygiene & perfect menu. Let’s make them work for the brand. This way customer base will be increased and as they grow with the brand, we grow. SIMPLE & CLEAR.

Brief Solution for Problem 2. We & people around us using plastic/disposables/paper cups which is coated with polyethylene (a petroleum based product). Which is really harmful for humans and nature. We generate tons of plastic/paper cups waste throwing into the nature, 85% of plastic/paper waste never being recycled. So here is the solution for the problem. Clay Cups & Eatable Cups. As of now these clay cups & eatable cups are little higher in price to buy for USE & THROW. When it has high demand, price might become low. More over this is HEALTHY.
